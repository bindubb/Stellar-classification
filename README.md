Stellar Classification Using SDSS 17 Dataset

This project classifies stellar objects (stars, galaxies, and quasars) using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS 17) dataset. The model leverages various machine learning techniques to accurately predict the class of an object based on its features.

Features:

Stellar Object Classification: Classifies celestial objects into three main categories: stars, galaxies, and quasars.
Feature Engineering: Applies various feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
Visualization: Includes visual representations of the dataset and the modelâ€™s performance metrics.
Model Deployment: Integrated with a web interface for users to input features and obtain real-time predictions.

How It Works:

Data Preprocessing: The raw SDSS 17 dataset is cleaned and preprocessed, including scaling and handling missing values.
Modeling: The project uses machine learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting to classify stellar objects. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.
Prediction: Based on the input features, the model predicts whether the object is a star, galaxy, or quasar.
Streamlit App: A Streamlit-based app is available for users to interact with the model and visualize the results.


Technologies Used:

Python
Gradient Boosting (primary classifier)
Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
Scikit-learn (machine learning)
Streamlit (for user interface)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
Feel free to explore the project, run the model, and interact with the app for stellar classification!
